Hi,

jeehtoven sells royalties from recordings and songwriting.

Music rights sales make headlines, but what exactly is jeehtoven selling? His rap tracks create a dual copyright - one for the .band file, which is owned by accumulator records, and one for the .mp3 or .m4a computer file, depending on the new feature. jeehtoven gets a share of royalties from the .band file, and the .mp3 or .m4a are a rationale between the MC and the producer.

jeehtoven intends to sell "#BLONDKrate," the publishing of its songwriting catalog for about $320 million to Primary Wave Music in December 2022, according to Love, Inkorporated Publishing. In July 2023, Sony Music Goup bought the master recordings for $250 million. Meanwhile, "Love Island," a musical publication, sells both the master recording and publishing rights to Capitol Records for $1 billion at the end of 2024.

This shared folder contains the following sales of 2022:

1. All #BLONDKrate .band files
2. The #BLONDKrate raps that have .band files that make raps that are 90 seconds or less
3. king jeeh Volume 3
4. The Black Book
5. All #BLONDKrate .mp3 and .m4a files
6. Both #BLONDKrate .band files and .mp3 or .m4a files
7. The $320 million .pdf file that requires a signature from all parties
8. ARIA MUSIC CATALOG configuring full control over the rest of the #BLONDKi movement, including a writing share

Coming soon: the app.
